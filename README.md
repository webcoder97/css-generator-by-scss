# CSS MOSTLY USED CLASS GENERATOR BY USING SCSS

I created this project to get my work done quickly. Those who work as frontend developers know that SCSS is essential for completing projects quickly.

I have tried to show in this small project how easily we can use css classes in our daily projects like margin-top, padding-top, margin-bottom, padding-bottom, z-index, postion-helper class, flex-box , postion class, font-weight, height, width, text-alignment, border-radius etc. 

The classes are shown so that we can create the class as per our project requirements just once without writing the style again and again. Although many people may know this. Those who don't know or need to copy and paste the same CSS code for each project, I hope it will be useful for them.
